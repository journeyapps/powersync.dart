# PowerSync with SQLCipher SDK for Flutter

_[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a sync engine for building local-first apps with instantly-responsive UI/UX and simplified state transfer. Syncs between SQLite on the client-side and Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL on the server-side._

This package (`powersync_sqlcipher`) is the PowerSync client SDK for Flutter with encryption enabled using SQLCipher. It is currently in a **beta** release. This means it is safe to use in production, provided that you've tested your use cases.

If you do not require encryption in your Flutter application, we recommend using the [`powersync`](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync) SDK.

### Installing PowerSync with SQLCipher encryption in your own project

Install the latest version of the package, for example:

```bash
flutter pub add powersync_sqlcipher
```

Version history can be found [here](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync_sqlcipher/versions).

### Usage

This SDK requires a slightly different setup to the `powersync` package in order to encrypt the local database:

```Dart
import 'package/powersync_sqlcipher/powersync.dart';

/// Global reference to the database
late final PowerSyncDatabase db;

final cipherFactory = PowerSyncSQLCipherOpenFactory(
      path: path, key: "sqlcipher-encryption-key"); // https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-api/#key

db = PowerSyncDatabase.withFactory(cipherFactory, schema: schema);
```
