# PowerSync with SQLCipher SDK for Flutter

_[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a sync engine for building local-first apps with instantly-responsive UI/UX and simplified state transfer. Syncs between SQLite on the client-side and Postgres or MongoDB on the server-side (MySQL coming soon)._

This package (`powersync_sqlcipher`) is the PowerSync client SDK for Dart/Flutter with encryption enabled using SQLCipher.

# Installation

```bash
flutter pub add powersync_sqlcipher
```

# Getting Started

Our [full SDK reference](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/flutter) contains everything you need to know to get started implementing PowerSync in your project.

This SDK requires a slightly different setup in order to encrypt the local database.

### Usage

```Dart
import 'package/powersync_sqlcipher/powersync.dart';

/// Global reference to the database
late final PowerSyncDatabase db;

final cipherFactory = PowerSyncSQLCipherOpenFactory(
      path: path, key: "sqlcipher-encryption-key");

db = PowerSyncDatabase.withFactory(cipherFactory, schema: schema);
```

### Installing PowerSync in your own project

Install the latest version of the package, for example:

```
flutter pub add powersync_sqlcipher: ^0.1.0
```

The latest version can be found [here](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync_sqlcipher/versions).

### Demo app

The easiest way to test out the powersync is to run the [Supabase Todo-List](./demos/supabase-todolist) demo app:

1. Checkout [this repo's](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/master) `master` branch.

- Note: If you are an existing user updating to the latest code after a git pull, run `melos exec 'flutter pub upgrade'` in the repo's root and make sure it succeeds.

2. Run `melos prepare` in the repo's root
3. cd into the `demos/supabase-todolist` folder
4. If you havenâ€™t yet: `cp lib/app_config_template.dart lib/app_config.dart` (optionally update this config with your own Supabase and PowerSync project details).
5. Run `flutter run -d chrome`
