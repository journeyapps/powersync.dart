# PowerSync SDK for Dart/Flutter

*[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a sync engine for building local-first apps with instantly-responsive UI/UX and simplified state transfer. Syncs between SQLite on the client-side and Postgres, MongoDB or MySQL on the server-side.*

This package (`powersync`) is the PowerSync client SDK for Dart/Flutter.

See a summary of features [here](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/flutter).

# Installation

```bash
flutter pub add powersync
```

# Getting Started

Our [full SDK reference](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/flutter) contains everything you need to know to get started implementing PowerSync in your project. 

## **Web support - Beta**

Flutter Web support in version `^1.9.0` is currently in a beta release. It is functionally ready for production use, provided that you've tested your use cases. 

Please familiarize yourself with the limitations for Flutter Web documented [here](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/flutter/flutter-web-support#limitations).

### Demo app

The easiest way to test Flutter Web support is to run the [Supabase Todo-List](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/main/demos/supabase-todolist) demo app:

1. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/main).

- Note: If you are an existing user updating to the latest code after a git pull, run `melos exec 'flutter pub upgrade'` in the repo's root directory and make sure it succeeds.

2. Run `melos prepare` in the repo's root
3. cd into the `demos/supabase-todolist` folder
4. If you havenâ€™t yet: `cp lib/app_config_template.dart lib/app_config.dart` (optionally update this config with your own Supabase and PowerSync project details).
5. Run `flutter run -d chrome`

### Installing PowerSync in your own project

Install the [latest version](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync/versions) of the package, for example:

```
flutter pub add powersync:'^1.9.0'
```

#### Additional config

Additional config is required for web projects. Please see our docs [here](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/flutter/flutter-web-support#additional-config) for details.
