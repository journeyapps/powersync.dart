# PowerSync SDK for Dart/Flutter

_[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a Postgres-SQLite sync layer, which helps developers to create local-first real-time reactive apps that work seamlessly both online and offline._

This package (`powersync`) is the PowerSync client SDK for Dart/Flutter.

See a summary of features [here](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/flutter).

# Installation

```bash
flutter pub add powersync
```

# Getting Started

Our [full SDK reference](https://docs.powersync.com/client-sdk-references/flutter) contains everything you need to know to get started implementing PowerSync in your project.

## **_ Web support - Open alpha _**

Web support is currently in an alpha release. This Readme has been updated to reflect updates that are currently only relevant to this alpha release.

### Demo app

The easiest way to test out the alpha is to run the [Supabase Todo-List](./demos/supabase-todolist) demo app:

1. Checkout [this repo's](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/tree/alpha-release) `alpha_release` branch.

- Note: If you are an existing user updating to the latest code after a git pull, run `melos exec 'flutter pub upgrade'` in the repo's root and make sure it succeeds.

2. Run `melos prepare` in the repo's root
3. cd into the `demos/supabase-todolist` folder
4. If you havenâ€™t yet: `cp lib/app_config_template.dart lib/app_config.dart` (optionally update this config with your own Supabase and PowerSync project details).
5. Run `flutter run -d chrome`

### Installing PowerSync in your own project

Install the latest alpha version of the package, for example:

```
flutter pub add powersync:'^1.3.0-alpha.1'
```

The latest prerelease version can be found [here](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync/versions).

### Additional config

Web support requires `sqlite3.wasm` and `powersync_db.worker.js` assets to be served from the web application. This is typically achieved by placing the files in the project `web` directory.

- `sqlite3.wasm` can be found [here](https://github.com/powersync-ja/sqlite3.dart/releases/download/v0.1.0/sqlite3.wasm)
- `powersync_db.worker.js` can be found in the repo's [releases](https://github.com/powersync-ja/powersync.dart/releases) page.

Currently the Drift SQLite library is used under the hood for DB connections. See [here](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/web/#getting-started) for detailed compatibility
and setup notes.

The same code is used for initializing native and web `PowerSyncDatabase` clients.

### Limitations

The API for web is essentially the same as for native platforms. Some features within `PowerSyncDatabase` clients are not available.

Multiple tab support is not yet available. Using multiple tabs will break.

#### Imports

Flutter Web does not support importing directly from `sqlite3.dart` as it uses `dart:ffi`.

Change imports from

```Dart
import 'package/powersync/sqlite3.dart`
```

to

```Dart
import 'package/powersync/sqlite3_common.dart'
```

In code which needs to run on the Web platform. Isolated native specific code can still import from `sqlite3.dart`.

#### Database connections

Web DB connections do not support concurrency. A single DB connection is used. `readLock` and `writeLock` contexts do not
implement checks for preventing writable queries in read connections and vice-versa.

Direct access to the synchronous `CommonDatabase` (`sqlite.Database` equivalent for web) connection is not available. `computeWithDatabase` is not available on web.
