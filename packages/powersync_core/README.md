# PowerSync SDK for Dart

_[PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com) is a sync engine for building local-first apps with instantly-responsive UI/UX and simplified state transfer. Syncs between SQLite on the client-side and Postgres or MongoDB on the server-side (MySQL coming soon)._

This package (`powersync_core`) is the PowerSync client SDK for Dart.

> **Note**
>
> This is a Dart library for Powersync for use cases such as server-side Dart or non-Flutter Dart environments.
>
> If you are developing a Flutter application, use [powersync](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync) or [powersync_sqlcipher](https://pub.dev/packages/powersync_sqlcipher) instead. The `powersync_core` package is for non-Flutter Dart environments.

# Installation

```bash
dart pub add powersync_core
```
